# Getting Started with the application

Remember to install dependencies when inside folder

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd watch
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### See application

Go to this URL http://localhost:3000 to see the running application

## Frameworks

I have used some well known framewokrs to build the application, with it
comes alot of functionalities out of the box, so the programming seems easy.
Down below you can see the frameworks i have used for the project.

- React
- Materiual UI

### How it's structured

Because the aplication is a ONE PAGE application, i have decided to
structre it in sections, and not make seperate folders for pages
and templates. All the sections can be found under ./src/components

### Where do the data come from

I havent set a backend up so all the data comes from JsonFiles,
you can find them under ./src/data
